# alfred-sheets
 

Inspired by `I-sheet-you-not`, this Workflow provides the means to create new Workflows to access individual Google Sheets.


## Setting up ‚öôÔ∏è
Note: this is more complex than the average workflow. I tried to document all the steps below, feel free to point to unclear steps or instructions. 
Steps 1-x are needed to access public Google Sheets. Additional steps x-y are needed to access private Google Sheets. 
### If the Google sheet is public
1. with the spreadsheet open in the frontmost browser, launch Alfred, enter the keyword (default: 'www') or custom hotkey. If this is a Google sheet, two options will appear: 
	1. browse the current sheet in Alfred using default settings
	2. create a new workflos for the current sheet
	
	 
2. 


1. the URL to the sheet
2. the columns to use (default: 1,2,3)
3. the title row (i.e., row with column titles, default: 1)


### If the Google sheet is private

1. Get google authentication

You can do one of three things:

1. Create a new workflow for a particular google sheet
2. in that workflow
	1. get the first three columns in alfred
	2. append a value to the main column


Set up Google Sheets API credentials:

1. Log into your Google account
1. Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
1. Using the `Select a project` dropdown menu, select an existing project or create a new one.
1. Click on `+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES` at the top of the page, then select  `Google Sheets API` for your project. Click on `ENABLE`
1. From the API Console, click 'Credentials' in the sidebar, then click on `+ CREATE CREDENTIALS` at the top of the page and select `Service account` to create a new service account key
	1. enter an account name (e.g. "MyAlfredAPI") and a description (e.g. "for Alfred Workflow")
	2. select 'application data` 
	3. Are you planning to use this API with Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, App Engine, or Cloud Functions? No
2. download the JSON file containing your service account credentials.
3. move that file to your preferred location, then enter the path to the file in `Key File` in `Workflow configuration`. This is required for the workflow to work. 

### If the Google sheet is private
1. Share the Google Sheet with the service account email address:
	- The service account email address can be found in the JSON file downloaded in the previous step. Share the Google Sheet with this email address, granting it the appropriate access permissions.

# Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è
- It might be possible have all the new workflows combined in a single workflow with one cluster of objects per spreadsheet
